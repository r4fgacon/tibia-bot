/** Reads what the Tibia client puts on the clipboard when you copy a party hunt
 *  session out of the party analyser.
 *
 *  The shape is a header block, then one block per member:
 *  {{{
 *  Session data: From 2026-09-01, 21:12:00 to 2026-09-01, 23:29:40
 *  Session: 02:17h
 *  Loot Type: Leader
 *  Loot: 14,359,954
 *  Supplies: 5,354,392
 *  Balance: 9,005,562
 *  The Wingga (Leader)
 *  	Loot: 11,518,496
 *  	...
 *  }}}
 *
 *  ==Why this does not read the indentation==
 *  The client indents a member's lines with a tab, which makes "is this a name or a
 *  value" look like a one-character question. It isn't: the text arrives here by way
 *  of a person's clipboard and a Discord textarea, and leading whitespace is exactly
 *  what that route is worst at preserving. A paste with the tabs eaten still has to
 *  split correctly, so the split is made on the only thing that survives — a line is
 *  a value if it reads `<known key>: <number>`, and anything else starts a member.
 *  Nothing in the format collides with that: Tibia names cannot contain a colon.
 *
 *  Pure and total: every failure comes back as a sentence to show the person who
 *  pasted, naming what was wrong rather than that something was.
