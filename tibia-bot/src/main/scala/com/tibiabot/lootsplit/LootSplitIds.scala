 *  drawn today sits on a respawn DM: nothing here touches a claim, a spawn or the
 *  database, and `RespawnModals` refuses outright anything submitted where there
 *  is no guild — which a DM is. Kept out of `interactions` so the respawn service
 *  can draw the row without the respawn package depending on the handlers that
 *  answer it.
 *
 *  Neither id carries any state. The whole input is the pasted text, so there is
 *  nothing to carry.
