/** `/lootsplit` — the same form the claim-ended DM offers, reachable without one.
 *
 *  The button is on a DM that only arrives when a respawn claim runs out, which
 *  means it is there for the hunts this bot already knows about and nowhere else.
 *  A party splitting a hunt they never claimed a spawn for, or splitting a second
 *  time after the button has been spent, has no way back to the form otherwise.
 *
   *  No options: the analysers are paragraphs of pasted text, and a slash command's
   *  arguments are a single line each. So this opens the form (five boxes, up to
   *  ten hunts combined) and does nothing else — which is also why it must not be
   *  deferred, and why `BotListener` treats it apart from every other command
   *  (see `SlashRouting.opensModal`).
