/** The slash-command dispatch table: invoked path -> handler. Kept separate from
 *  BotListener so it is unit-testable (SlashRoutingSpec checks it stays in step
 *  with the registered command schemas) and so adding a command is a one-line
 *  edit here next to the other routing config.
 *
 *  Keys are [[CommandPath]] paths, matched by longest registered prefix, so an
 *  entry can own a whole command ("hunted", which reads its own subcommand), a
 *  group, or a single leaf. A command with no subcommands is just its name.
 *
 *  Building this map only initialises the (stateless) handler objects, never
 *  BotApp, so it is cheap to reference from a test. */

   *  for a worker either, since nothing has acknowledged Discord yet. Kept here
   *  rather than in the handler because that is too late to be asked.
   *
   *  A [[CommandPath]] path like every other key here, so a form command folded
   *  under a root is named at the depth it actually lives at rather than
   *  silently matching — or missing — on the root alone.
